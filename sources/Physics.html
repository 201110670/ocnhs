                <details><summary>Velocity:(v=s/t)</summary>Velocity is the rate of change of the displacement, the difference between the final and initial position of an object. Velocity is equivalent to a specification of its speed and direction of motion</details>

                By one dimension we mean that the body is moving only in one plane and in a straight line. Like if we roll a marble on a flat table, and if we roll it in a straight line (not easy!), then it would be undergoing one-dimensional motion. There are four variables which put together in an equation can describe this motion. These are Initial Velocity (u); Final Velocity (v), Acceleration (a), Distance Traveled (s) and Time elapsed (t). The equations which tell us the relationship between these variables are as given below.

                <details><summary>Momentum: (p = mv)</summary>Momentum (p) is the quantity of motion in a body. A heavy body moving at a fast velocity is difficult to stop. A light body at a slow speed, on the other hand can be stopped easily. So momentum has to do with both mass and velocity.</details>
                <br/>
                
                <details><summary>Impulse: (Ft = mv - mu)</summary>This is the change in the momentum of a body caused over a very short time. Let m be the mass and v and u the final and initial velocities of a body.</details>

                <details><summary>Work and Energy:</summary>As we know from the law of conservation of energy: energy is always conserved.
                    Work is the product of force and the distance over which it moves. Imagine you are pushing a heavy box across the room. The further you move the more work you do! If W is work, F the force and x the distance then.</details>

                Transitional KE = ½ mv 2<br/>
                
                <details><summary>More Details</summary>Energy comes in many shapes. The ones we see over here are kinetic energy (KE) and potential energy (PE)<br/></details>
                
                    Rotational KE = ½ Iw 2
               <details><summary>More Details</summary> Here I is the moment of inertia of the object (a simple manner in which one can understand moment of inertia is to consider it to be similar to mass in transitional KE) and w is angular velocity</details><br/>
                
                <details><summary>Gravitational PE = mgh</summary><br/> where h is the height of the object</details>
                <details><summary>Elastic PE = ½ k L 2</summary><br/>where k is the spring constant ( it gives how much a spring will stretch for a unit force) and L is the length of the spring.</details>
                
                <details><summary>Power: (P = W/t) (P = E/t)<br/></summary>Power (P) is work( W) done in unit time (t)<br/>
                    as work and energy (E) are same it follows power is also energy consumed or generated per unit time.<br/>
                    In measuring power Horsepower is a unit which is in common use. However in physics we use Watt. So the first thing to do in solving any problem related to power is to convert horsepower to Watts. 1 horsepower (hp) = 746 Watts</details>

                <details><summary>Circular Motion:</summary><br/>In the diagram v is the tangential velocity of the object. a is the centripetal (acting towards the center of the circle) acceleration and F is the centripetal force. r is the radius of the circle and m is mass of the object.

                    as work and energy (E) are same it follows power is also energy consumed or generated per unit time.</details>
                (a = v 2 / r)<br/>

                    The mass of a substance contained in unit volume is its density (D).</details>
